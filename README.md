//EEL PVP Format: https://www.neopets.com/~EELRules
//"Multi-Healer Limitation: Each healing action is counted, with a maximum of 65 points allowed.
//Points:TMT=15,Blaze=15,Istaff=20,WoDF=30,ECApple=30,WoDN/RoN/RoSN=30, Others=0."




//How 2 Use:
1)When you do EEL battle,Above the battle log,in the black bar, you will see how many times your multi-healers healed.(Make it easier for oneself to follow the rules)
2)//Also, if there is a difference on MaxHp of 2 pets, this script helps note the number.The pet with higher health should immediately surrender when his/her health drops to or below this value.
